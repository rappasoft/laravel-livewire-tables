You can install the package via composer:

**Official Releases**
Version 3.x (Livewire 3.x Support)

``` bash
composer require rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables:^3.*
```

---


If you are actively developing your solution, and would prefer to receive updates prior to official releases, then there are two active branches:

**V3 Master**
(Branch Passes Automated Tests & Internal Testing)

This branch is considered stable, and will be populated in the days prior to a release.

``` bash
composer require rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables:dev-v3-master
```

---

**V3 Develop**
(Branch Passes Automated Tests)

This branch contains merges from a variety of contributors.  Automated tests MUST be performed against this branch, and PRs must pass the threshold, however manual testing of a PR into Develop is not guaranteed.

``` bash
composer require rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables:dev-v3-develop
```
