## Rendering Components

You render components the same way you [render](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components#rendering-components) any Livewire component.

Your component at `App\Livewire\UsersTable.php`

```html
<livewire:users-table />
```

## Theme

By default, all components will use the theme in the config file. But if for some reason you have different parts of your application using different frameworks, you can set the theme on a per-table basis:


```html
<livewire:users-table theme="bootstrap-4" />
```

## Using sub-folders

If your component does not live in `App\Livewire`, you can specify a different sub-folder. For example if your component lives in `App\Livewire\Backend\Users` you would use the following:

```html
<livewire:backend.users.users-table />
```

### Using non-standard locations

If for example you are using Domain Driven Development and you would like your component to live in `App\Domains\Auth\Users`, then you would register your component in a service provider so Livewire knows how to find it.

For example in LivewireServiceProvider:

```php
use Livewire\Livewire;
use App\Domains\Auth\Users\UsersTable;

public function boot(): void
{
    Livewire::component('backend.users.users-table', UsersTable::class);
}
```

```html
<livewire:backend.users.users-table />
```

## Passing Properties

Just like in standard Livewire components, you may pass properties and accept them in your mount method:

```html
<livewire:invoices-table status="open" />
```

```php
// Available as $this->status in datatable class or $status in views (if necessary)
public string $status;

// Optional, but if you need to initialize anything
public function mount(string $status): void {}
```
