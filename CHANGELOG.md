# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-livewire-tables` will be documented in this file

## [Unreleased]

## [2.14.0] - 2023-05-18

### Changed
- Fixes
    - Bulk Actions (AlpineJS)
    - Moving Table Head Checkbox to AlpineJS
    - Using AlpineJS for calculating if all items have been selected
    - Correcting missing x-cloak
    - Added indeterminateCheckbox for TH for bulk actions
    - Cleaned up ALpineJS functionality for Bulk Actions
    - Repair of tests that were looking for wire:model that no longer existed

- Enhancements
    - Several new public variables for accessing pagination data cleanly, to avoid calling functions repeatedly across various blades.
        - paginationTotalItemCount (Total number of items in the results across all page)
        - paginationCurrentItems (Primary keys of items in the current page)
        - paginationCurrentCount (Number of results on the current page)

- Blades
    - Several blades have had the classic Tables approach ($theme == 'tailwind', $theme == 'bootstrap) replaced with conditional classes using the @class([]) approach.  This is to reduce the complexity of the blade files.
